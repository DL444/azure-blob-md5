# AzureBlobMd5
Azure Blob Storage can optionally calculate the MD5 hash of the blobs you uploaded. The hash is Base64 encoded and stored in the blob properties. This utility calculates and displays the hash in the same way so you can manually validate the hash after uploading and downloading.

## Usage
Just serve file paths as arguments.
